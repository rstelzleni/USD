(NonboundableLightBase)=
# NonboundableLightBase

The base class for intrinsic lights that are 
not boundable (e.g. DistantLight, DomeLight, etc.). As non-boundable lights 
have no scene bounds, they typically do not use positional information for
their lighting calculations. Provides a direct API to the
functionality provided by LightAPI for concrete derived lights.
See {ref}`usdLux_nonboundable_lights` for more details and examples of 
non-boundable intrinsic lights.
