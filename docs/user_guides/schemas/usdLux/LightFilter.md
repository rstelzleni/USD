Use the filterLink collection to specify which
geometry Prims to be included or excluded from this light filter. Prims 
excluded or not included will not be affected by this light filter. 

The `includeRoot` attribute indicates whether the pseudo-root path `/` should 
be counted as one of the included target paths. Note that the fallback value 
is true, which means that light filters will affect all objects illuminated
by the light(s) the filter is associated with.
