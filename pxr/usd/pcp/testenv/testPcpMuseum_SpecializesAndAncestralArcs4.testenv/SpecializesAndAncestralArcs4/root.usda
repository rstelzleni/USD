    This exercises combinations of inherits and specializes arcs
    along with composition of ancestral opinions.

    The main prims to examine are /Parent/Child and /Parent2/Child.
    The latter is the same as the former but adds an ancestral
    specializes arc. The specs that are common between these two
    prims should be in the same relative order.
