# Overview

The UsdUI schema domain contains schemas for working with general user interface 
related features. One use-case is using UsdUI for describing aspects of nodes in
graphs, such as configuring layout hints, node coloration, and so on.
UsdUI allows the user to describe where UI nodes are with `NodeGraphNodeAPI`, 
add descriptive labels and groups to nodes with `SceneGraphPrimAPI`, and to 
visually organize nodes with Backdrops.

Node graphs can be used to describe networks of prims, such as shading and 
material networks. Consumers such as DCC Tools can visualize node graphs and 
make complex networks easier to understand. Use the schemas provided by UsdUI 
to provide hints on how node graphs should be visualized.

## Working With Node Graphs

The `SceneGraphPrimAPI` allows each node to contain a descriptive name 
(`ui:displayName`) and a descriptive group (`ui:displayGroup`).

The `NodeGraphNodeAPI` defines how each node appears in the node graph. 
This includes its position (`ui:nodegraph:node:pos`), color
(`ui:nodegraph:node:displayColor`), a link to documentation about the node 
(`ui:nodegraph:node:docURI`), the amount of information the node currently
displays (`ui:nodegraph:node:expansionState`), an icon image to express the
node's intent (`ui:nodegraph:node:icon`), its size (`ui:nodegraph:node:size`),
and its relative depth to other nodes in the graph 
(`ui:nodegraph:node:stackingOrder`). The units for `ui:nodegraph:node:pos` 
are not meant to be pixels but assume the typical node size is 1.0x1.0. For 
`ui:nodegraph:node:pos` Y-positive is intended to be down. Positions are 
relative to parent nodes, if any parent nodes exist.

```{note}
USD doesn't provide any synchronization of node attributes such as
`displayColor` and `pos` with similarly named attributes from other schemas,
such as GPrim's `primvars:displayColor`. It is up to the application 
implementing how node elements are displayed to provide any sort of 
automatic synchronization if desired.
```

Backdrops provide a way to visually group nodes and provide a useful 
description for that group. Unlike `SceneGraphPrimAPI.displayGroup`, 
backdrops are not directly associated with nodes. Visual size and position 
of a backdrop is determined using `NodeGraphNodeAPI` properties.

As an example, presume that we have an application with a node graph that looks 
like this:

![Example screenshot](usdUINodeGraph.svg)

The node graph, including its user interface-related properties, can be 
represented in USD as follows:

```{code-block} usda
def Material "Material"
{
    token outputs:mtlx:surface.connect = </World/Material/PreviewSurface.outputs:out>

    def Shader "PreviewSurface" (
        prepend apiSchemas = ["NodeGraphNodeAPI"]
    )
    {
        uniform token info:id = "ND_UsdPreviewSurface_surfaceshader"
        color3f inputs:diffuseColor.connect = </World/Material/Color.outputs:out>
        token outputs:out
        uniform color3f ui:nodegraph:node:displayColor = (0.780, 0.698, 0.6)
        uniform token ui:nodegraph:node:expansionState = "open"
        uniform float2 ui:nodegraph:node:pos = (-.85, 1.9)
    }

    def Shader "Color" (
        prepend apiSchemas = ["NodeGraphNodeAPI"]
    )
    {
        uniform token info:id = "ND_constant_color3"
        color3f inputs:value = (1, 0.023, 0.701)
        color3f outputs:out
        uniform color3f ui:nodegraph:node:displayColor = (0.549, 0.133, 1.0)
        uniform token ui:nodegraph:node:expansionState = "closed"
        uniform float2 ui:nodegraph:node:pos = (-2, 2)
    }

    def Backdrop "Backdrop" (
        prepend apiSchemas = ["NodeGraphNodeAPI"]
    )
    {
        uniform token ui:description = "Do not edit!"
        uniform color3f ui:nodegraph:node:displayColor = (0.764, 1.0, 0.698)
        uniform float2 ui:nodegraph:node:pos = (-0.8, 0.5)
        uniform float2 ui:nodegraph:node:size = (450, 330)
    }
}

```

While not all possible variations are shown above, the following can be 
observed:
- `ui:nodegraph:node:displayColor` helps distinguish nodes quickly
- `ui:description` in Backdrop can provide context for regional
groupings in a node graph
- `ui:nodegraph:node:expansionState` controls how much information a node 
displays, note the difference in detail between `PreviewSurface` vs `Color`
- `ui:nodegraph:node:size` and `ui:nodegraph:node:pos` determine the 
placement and relative positioning of nodes in a node graph.

## Working With Accessibility Information

The `AccessibilityAPI` schema describes accessibility information on a Prim that 
may be surfaced to a given runtime's accessibility frameworks. This information 
may be used by assistive features in tools, such as voice controls or screen 
readers.

Accessibility information is provided as a standard triplet of label, 
description, and priority. This is a multiple apply schema, and so may have 
multiple namespaced accessibility triplets, where a instance name may reflect a 
given purpose for that triplet. The following simple example provides
multiple triplets of accessibility information for a Prim.

```{code-block} usda
def Mesh "Cube" (
    prepend apiSchemas = ["AccessibilityAPI"]
) {
    string accessibility:default:label = "Regular cube"
    string accessibility:default:description = "A plain featureless cube"
    token accessibility:default:priority = "standard"

    string accessibility:size:label = "Regular sized cube"
    string accessibility:size:description = "A 4-meter featureless cube"
    token accessibility:size:priority = "low"
}
```

Note that this schema will use "default" as an instance name if no namespace is 
specified.

See {ref}`AccessibilityAPI` for additional best practices for using this schema.
