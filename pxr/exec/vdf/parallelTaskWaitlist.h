/// This class manages lists of tasks waiting on uncompleted work. One instance
/// of this class can manage multiple independent queues denoted by separate
/// VdfParallelTaskWaitlist::HeadPtr instances.
/// 
/// The client is expected to instantiate one or more heads, and then use the
/// methods WaitOn(), to wait on completion of the work denoted by those heads
/// respectively. Once the work has been completed, CloseAndNotify() can be
/// called to close the waiting list denoted by the respective head, and
/// simultanously notify all the currently waiting tasks to continue their
/// execution - assuming their task reference count reaches 0. Tasks with
/// reference counts greater than 0 are still waiting on other, unfulfilled
/// dependencies.
/// 
/// The client is expected to call Rewind() once all heads have been closed and
/// notified. This ensures that the internal state of this class has been reset,
/// and its allocated memory does not grow past invocations of Rewind().
